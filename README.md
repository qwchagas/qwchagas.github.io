## Hello!


I've been working on Quantum Computing since my PhD, researching on Quantum Walks and its algorithms and physical realizations. I'm interested in analyzing different models of Quantum Walks on graphs, construct a quantum circuit that implements it and perform applications on searching problems and transport properties. Recently, I was hired as computational scientist at Irish Centre for High-End Computing, Ireland, to join projects in Quantum Chemistry in NISQ computers.
