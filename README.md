## Hello!


I've been working on Quantum Computing since my PhD, researching on Quantum Walks and its algorithms and physical realizations. I'm interested in analyzing different models of Quantum Walks on graphs, construct a quantum circuit that implements it and perform applications on searching problems and transport properties.
